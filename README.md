# MacOs_Install

# The script in question was developed to automate the configuration of the MacOs Mojave theme on Linux distributions using GNOME.

# As I routinely change operating systems, but I like the MacOs Mojave theme, I decided to create a script to make the process easier.

Steps:

1 - Open Tweaks - Appearance:
  
  * Once the theme is installed you can apply the theme to your current desktop
  * Change the icons to macOS Mojave theme
  * Apply the macOS cursor set

2 - Remove the default Gnome Dock Panel

3 - Configure the Plank application to start after reboot
